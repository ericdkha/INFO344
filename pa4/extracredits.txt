For the extra credits, I decided to do the “Beautiful search results page (styling, photos, etc). I implemented a minimalist layout, sorted of based on Google’s layout. For the NBA Player search results, I added the team’s logo to the background of the player’s name. To do this, I just went to NBA.com and found where their website pulls the logos from, and then I just created a query to get the logo with the player’s team and added it to the html through javascript. To see this, just type in any player name, like “lebron james”, and it should automatically pull up LeBron James’ stats along with the logo of his team.
The other extra credit that I implemented was the “Google Instant” function. Every keystroke made sends an asynchronous request to query for cnn titles with that keyword as well as show query suggestions and player data if a player was found. To trigger this, just start typing any word.
